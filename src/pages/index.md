## Hi there!

I'm Hoàng Minh Thiên, a.k.a. hmthien050209 (or davidhoang05022009 in
the past).

I'm a student in the 2024–2027 Specialized Interdisciplinary Informatics class
at VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted (PTNK), Viet Nam.

## My skills

- C/C++ (intermediate)
- C# (WPF MVVM, ASP.NET)
- Go
- Flutter
- Web development (most familiar with Vue + TailwindCSS or Astro, but I can use
  Angular and React also)
- Python, Bash (mostly for automating tasks on server environments)
- Linux (intermediate)
- Docker

## My history

### The early days

I fell in love with computers when I was studying in grade 3. Back then, I
played with VMWare and Windows Server out of curiosity. After a year of messing
around with others' software, I should try to write my software. The first
programming language I learned was C, then C#, then Python, and many more.

I was a self-taught developer back then because my family is not programming
related in any way.

### Junior high school

When I was studying in grade 7 (when the COVID-19 struck), I learned about Linux, especially Fedora Linux.
I learned how to write
a [post-install script](https://github.com/hmthien050209/fedora-post-install-script)
to streamline the post-installation things (back then, I messed up my system a
lot, so re-installation happens every week 🙂). At the same time, I learned how
to write mobile apps with Flutter, with the following noticeable projects:

- [app_dieu_khien_gau](https://github.com/hmthien050209/app_dieu_khien_gau):
  This is just a joke program inspired
  from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lHnlc5UIs&t=9m50s) (at
  9:50), re-wrote with Flutter (the original app is written with ElectronJS).
- [app_trieu_hoi_gau](https://github.com/hmthien050209/app_trieu_hoi_gau): A
  joke mobile app to call your BF/GF inspired
  by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGKrMzgY9E)
- [todo_app](https://github.com/hmthien050209/todo_app): A todo app I decided to
  write when I learned more about state management in Flutter. This project is
  not completed yet 🙁

In grade 8 and 9, I wrote some web games (mostly written with Vue) for use in my
presentations; some of them are:

- [quiz-game](https://github.com/hmthien050209/quiz-game): the first version of
  cross-word + multiple choices game for use in my team's literature
  presentation in my class.
- [history-quiz-game](https://github.com/hmthien050209/history-quiz-game): an
  upgraded version with lazy-loading routes.
- [access-self-check-game](https://github.com/hmthien050209/access-self-check-game)
  and [access-c6-game](https://github.com/hmthien050209/access-c6-game): these
  games are written for use in my team's English presentation. The server
  communicates with the clients (my classmates' phones) via Socket.io. This
  project is hacky in many ways, for example, I didn't have any domain, so I
  just run a hotspot on my phone and connect all the clients.

### At PTNK

Currently, at PTNK, I help maintaining the online judging infrastructure for the
Informatics classes to use. I also developed an online IDE
called [PTNK IDE](https://ide.ptnkoj.com) to reduce our student's
time-to-develop.

> I plan to make PTNK IDE open source soon. For now, it's fragile and needs
> heavy-refactoring (or even re-write from scratch).

### At The Gifted Battlefield

I'm also a member of The Gifted Battlefield, a non-profit organization of high schoolers specialized in educational
activities. I'm a member of the Informatics Infrastructure Development (IID) Department, where I help building and
maintaining web services serving the high school students in Viet Nam (especially in Ho Chi Minh City).

## About this website

This website is created as a place to share my knowledge, to write things that
randomly appear in my mind. I want to build a better world, and to do it, we
need to share knowledge so that we can improve every day!
